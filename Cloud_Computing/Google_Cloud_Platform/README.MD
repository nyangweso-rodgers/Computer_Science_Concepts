# 1.Interacting with Google Cloud Platform
* __Cloud Platform console__ (web user interface)
* __Cloud Shell and Cloud Software Development Kitt (SDK)__ (command-line inteface)
* __Cloud console mobile App__ (for iOS and Android)
* __REST-based API__ (for custom applications)

# 2.GCP Services
## 2.1 Computing Services
### 2.1.1 Compute Engine
let's you run _virtual machines_ on demand in the cloud. It's Google Cloud _Infrastructure as a Service_ solution. It provides maximum flexibility for people who prefer to manage server instances themselves.
### 2.1.2 Kubernetes Engine 
let's you run containerized applications on a card environment that Google manages for you under your administrative control.
### 2.1.3 App Engine__ is GCP fully managed __PaaS__ framework. i.e., it's a way to run code in the cloud without worrying about infrastructure.
### 2.1.4 Cloud Functions
is a completely serverless execution environment or _functions as a service_. It executes your code in response to events, whether these events occur once a day or many times for a second.

## 2.2 Storage Services
### 2.2.1 Bigtable
### 2.2.2 Cloud Storage
### 2.2.3 Cloud SQL
### 2.2.4 Cloud Spanner
### 2.2.5 Cloud Datastore

## 2.3 Big Data Services
### 2.3.1 Big Query
This is a fully managed data warehouse. It provides real-time interactive analysis of massive data sets (hundreds of TBs) using __SQL__ syntax.
#### Advantages
* No cluster maintenance is required
* You only pay for storage and processing used

### 2.3.2 Pub/Sub: _scalable and flexible enterprise messaging_
### 2.3.3 Data Flow: _Stream and batch, processing unified and simplified pipelines_
### 2.3.4 Data Proc: _Managed Hadoop, MapReduce, Spark, Pig and Hive Service._
### 2.3.5 Data lab: _interactive data exploration_

## 2.4 Machine Learning
### 2.4.1 Natural Language API
### 2.4.2 Vision API
### 2.4.3 Machine Learning
### 2.4.4 Speech API
### 2.4.5 Translate API
