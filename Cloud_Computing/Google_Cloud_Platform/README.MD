# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Interacting with Google Cloud Platform
* __Cloud Platform console__ (web user interface)
* __Cloud Shell and Cloud Software Development Kitt (SDK)__ (command-line inteface)
* __Cloud console mobile App__ (for iOS and Android)
* __REST-based API__ (for custom applications)

## 4 GCP Services
1. Computing
2. Storage
3. Big Data
3. Machine Learning

### 1. Computing Services
* __Compute Engine__ let's you run _virtual machines_ on demand in the cloud. It's Google Cloud Infrastructure as a Service solution. It provides maximum flexibility for people who prefer to manage server instances themselves.
* __Kubernetes Engine__ let's you run containerized applications on a card environment that Google manages for you under your administrative control.
* __App Engine__ is GCP fully managed __PaaS__ framework. i.e., it's a way to run code in the cloud without worrying about infrastructure.
* __Cloud Functions__ is a completely serverless execution environment or functions as a service. It executes your code in response to events, whether these events occur once a day or many times for a second.

### 2. Storage Services
* Bigtable
* Cloud Storage
* Cloud SQL
* Cloud Spanner
* Cloud Datastore

### 3. Big Data Services
* Big Query: _Analytics database._
* Pub/Sub: _scalable and flexible enterprise messaging_
* Data Flow: _Stream and batch, processing unified and simplified pipelines_
* Data Proc: _Managed Hadoop, MapReduce, Spark, Pig and Hive Service._
* Data lab: _interactive data exploration_

### 4. Machine Learning
* Natural Language API
* Vision API
* Machine Learning
* Speech API
* Translate API


## Introduction Google Cloud
### Using GCP
1. Google Cloud Platform Console - _web user interface_
2. Cloud Shell and Cloud SDK - _command-line interface_
3. REST-based API - _for custom applications_
4. Cloud Mobile App - _for iOS and Android_

1. __BigQuery__: 
This is a fully managed data warehouse. It provides real-time interactive analysis of massive data sets (hundreds of TBs) using __SQL__ syntax.
* No cluster maintenance is required
* You only pay for storage and processing used
