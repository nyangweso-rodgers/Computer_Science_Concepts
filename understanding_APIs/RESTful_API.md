## What is RESTful API?

a __RESTful API__ (RESTful web service) is based on __Representational State Transfer__ (REST) technology, which is an architectural style and approach to communication often used in web service development. __RESTful API__ is mostly used for HTTP web APIs where there is no need for any additional or package to be installed.

__RESTful__ itself is very flexible. There are not many limitations, but developers refer to best practices when architecturing a REST API. REST has the ability to handle multiple types of requests and return different types of data (such as JSON and XML)
