# WHAT IS AN API (Application Programming Interface)

## wwww and remote servers:
   every page on the internet is stored somewhere on a remote server (a part of a remotely located computer that is optimized to process request).

## EXAMPL:
when you type into your browser, a request goes out to Facebook remote server. Once your browser receives the response, it interprets the code and displays the page.
--> to the browser (also known as the client), Facebook's server is an API --> every time you visit a page on a web, you interact with some remote server's API.

## REMARK: 
	an API isn't the same as remote server - rather it's the part of the server that receives requests and sends requests.
