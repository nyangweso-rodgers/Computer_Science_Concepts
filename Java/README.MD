## Fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming in Java
### Object Orientation
Style of programming in which the unit of behavior is an __object__ which consists of __State__ (date, held in fields) and __behavior__ (methods, functions)

### Why Object Orientation?
* almost universal in the software industry
* useful for analysis, design and coding
* most successful for managing complexity - _supports decoupling of subsystems_ and _encorages reuse of components_
* design rationale for much of Java language.

## Encapsulation
protects the object's field from external access.
