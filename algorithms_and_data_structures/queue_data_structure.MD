# Queue Data Structure
A __queue__ is a First In, First Out (FIFO) collection. This is a contrast to a __stack__ collection i.e., First In, Last Out collection. i.e., queue returns items in the same order they were added.

* __Enque__ adding an item into the queue.
* __Deque__ removing an item from the queue

## Implementations of Queue data structure
1. Linked List for the item storage
2. Array implementation

## Priority Queue
__Priority Queue__ differs from the normal queue in that they are not First In, First Out, but rather, they return the highest priority items first, regardless of the order of in which they were added to the Queue.
