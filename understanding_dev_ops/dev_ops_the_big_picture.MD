# DevOps: The Big Picture

## Introduction
### Introducing DevOps
1. Culture
2. Automation
3. Lean
4. Metrics
5. Sharing - Continuos Learning

__DevOps__ Cultural thing and a new way of working.

__Goal of DevOps__ _continuos improvements_

## Making DevOps Transition
1. Change culture: start with why
2. change culture: empowerment of the teams
3. change culture: accountability
4. change culture: teamwork
5. change culture: learning
6. change culture: reinforcing values
7. change organization: understand customers and bottlenecks
8. change organization: remove inconsistencies via automation
9. change organization: build in quality and breakdown communication barriers
10. change organization: rethink team approach
11. change organization: alter team structure
12. change organization: eliminate waste

## Addressing DevOps objections
1. "_DevOps makes us less secure_"
2. "_we have offshore teams_"
3. "_you are eliminating our Ops team_"
4. "_i've got too much COTS and legacy code_"
5. "_we don't have these skills_"

## Introducing DevOps Automation
### The Right Technologies to Enable DevOps
#### DevOps Tool Chain
1. Planning
2. Issue Tracking
3. Source Control
4. Build and Testing Tools
5. Continuos Integration Tools
6. Continous Deployment
7. Configuration Management
8. Cloud Platforms
9. Monitoring and Logging
10. Improved Communication.
11. Knowledge Sharing

##### 1. Planning Tools
Are often online tools e.g., GitLab, Azure Board, Trello

##### 2. Issue Tracking Tools
_Why it matters to DevOps_: customer responsiveness, limited knowledge wate, feedback loop.
e.g., Atlassian Jira, ZenDesk.

##### 3. Source Control Management Tools
_Why it matters to DevOps_:Asset control, limit transportation waste, empower teams. e.g., git, github, bitbucket, gitlab, subversion.

##### 4. Build Tools
_Why it matters to DevOps_:consistent packaging, automates an error-prone activity, yield early quality signals. e.g., Maven/Gradle, MSBuild, Rake, JFrogArtifactory, Sonatype, NuGet.

##### 5. Test Tools
_Why it matters to DevOps_:puts focus on built-in quality, creates confidence in deployed artifacts. e.g., JUnit, XUnit.net, Selenium, Jasmine, Cucumber.

##### 6. Continuos Integration
_Why it matters to DevOps_:Fast feedback, reduce defect waste and waiting waste. e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, Concourse, AWS CodePipelines, Azure Pipelines.

##### 7. Continuos Deployment
_Why it matters to DevOps_: Limit your pre-production inventory , automate complex pipelines, unify team around getting value to customers. e.g., Spinnaker, Octopus Deploy, AWS CodeDeploy.

##### 8. Configuration Managemnet
_Why it matters to DevOps_:enforce consistency, treat infrastructure as code. e.g., Terrform, BOSH, Chef, Ansible, Puppet, Google Cloud Deployment Manager.

##### 9. Cloud Platforms
_Why it matters to DevOps_:Automation friendly, observable runtimes for software. e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Heroku, Container Scheduler.

##### 10. Monitoring and Logging
_Why it matters to DevOps_:Fast recovery, responsiveness, transparency, limited human involvement during incidents. e.g., ELK Stack, Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus, Zipkin, Azure Monitor.

##### 11. Knowledge Sharing and Communication
_Why it matters to DevOps_:connect teams, limit waiting waste, improve collaboration. e.g., slack, zoom, microsoft teams, google hangouts. e.g., GitHub pages, Confluence, Jekyll, Google sites.
