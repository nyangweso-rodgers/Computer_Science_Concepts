1. Create an application folder
2. add package definition and configuration files
3. install the packages
4. creates an App's Angular module
5. create the main.ts file
6. create the host web page(index.html)

https://github.com/angular/angular-cli
* Angular CLI is a command line tool for generating the set of files and boilerplate code for an Angular application.
* the CLI also generates your component;s modules, services, and other files.
* it scaffolds and executes your unit in end-to-end tests, and provides options to minimize package and prepare the files you need for deployment.
