# TypeScript
* Typescript is an open Language that is a superset of JS and compiles to plain JS through transpilation.
* it is strongly typed, so every variable, every function, and every function parameter can have a data type.
* Typescript implements the ES2015 class-based object orientation, e.t.c.,
* it implements classes, interfaces and inheritance 


## How does Typescript determine the appropriate types when using JS libraries that are not strongly styped?
* by using Typescript type definition files.
* these files contain the definition of each type in a library.
* these files are named with a library name (.d.ts)
