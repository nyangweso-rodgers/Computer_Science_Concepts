# Algorithms and Data Structure - part 2
## Sorting Algorithms
__Sorting__ involves arranging data in a collection based on a comparison algorithm. Two general families of sroting algorithms:
1. Linear Sorting
2. Divide and Conquer

__Linear Algorithms__ treat the problem of sorting as a single large operation. __Divide and Coquer__ algorithms on the other hand, partition the data to be sorted into smaller sets that can be independently sorted.
