# Sorting ALgorithms
## Bubble Sort
This is the simplest __sorting algorithm__. On each pass:
* Compare each array item to its' right neighbor
* if the right neighbor is smaller then Swap right and left
* repeat the remaining array items.

### Bubble Sort Performance
* Worst case performance: O(n<sup>2</sup>) - not appropriate for large unsorted data sets.
* Average case performance: O(n<sup>2</sup>) - not appropriate for large unsorted data sets.
* Best case performance: O(n) - very good best case performance can efficiently sort small and nearly sorted datasets.
