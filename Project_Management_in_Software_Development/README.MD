# Scrum Definition
__Scrum__ is a _lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems._ i.e., __Scrum__ requires a __Scrum Master__ to foster an environment where:
1. A __Product Owner__ orders the work for a complex problem into a __Product Backlog__.
2. The __Scrum Team__ turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
3. The __Scrum Team__ and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4. Repeat

__Scrum__ employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed.

## Scrum Values
These 5 values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior.
1. __Commitment__: _The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other._
2. __Focus__: _Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals_
3. __Openness__: _The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges._ 
4. __Respect__: _Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work_
5. __Courage__: _The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems._

## Scrum Team
The __Scrum Team__ consists of:
1.  _one Scrum Master_, 
2. _one Product Owner_, 
3. _and Developers_. 

Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the __Product Goal__.

### Developers
__Developers__ are the people in the __Scrum Team__ that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint. The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the __Developers__ are always accountable for:
- Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;
- Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;
- Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,
- Holding each other accountable as professionals.

### Product Owner
The __Product Owner__ is accountable for _maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team_. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

The __Product Owner__ is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:
- Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
- Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
- Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

The __Product Owner__ may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.

For __Product Owners__ to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.

### Scrum Master
The __Scrum Master__ is _accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide_. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization.

The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness. They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.

Scrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization. 

The __Scrum Master__ serves the __Scrum Team__ in several ways, including:
- Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality;
- Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done;
- Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,
- Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.

The __Scrum Master__ serves the __Product Owner__ in several ways, including:
- Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management;
- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
- Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment; and,
- Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.

The __Scrum Master__ serves the __organization__ in several ways, including:
- Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;
- Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization;
- Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work; and,
- Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.
