A __set__ is a collection of elements.

## Set Algorithms
* Union
* Intersection
* Set Difference - returns all the elements in the first set that are not in the second set.
* Symmetric Difference -  a set algorithm that takes two input sets and returns a third set that contains all of the members of both input sets that are not in the other.
